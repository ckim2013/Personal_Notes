# Text Analyzing

## Random Snippets
- Inside ruby is a `File` class.
- The code, `File.open('text.txt').each { |line| puts line }` opens up a txt file class and `puts` each line onto the screen using the `each` method.
- `File.readlines('text.txt')` creates an array with each line being an element in the array. Also includes spaces between paragraphs of texts.
